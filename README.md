## Java sample project

[![Build Status](https://public1.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/5159d3de-2a96-42d2-8a05-8fd1220d8396/17/badge)](https://public1.visualstudio.com/dastahel/dastahel%20Team/_build/index?context=allDefinitions&path=%5C&definitionId=17)

### Warning

If you use this project to test vsts creating builds automatically from YAML files, please remember, that you first have to RENAME either .vsts-ci-gradle.yml or .vsts-ci-maven.yml to .vsts-ci.yml

VSTS cannot decide which build system you want to use, and so reads ONLY .vsts-ci.yml file by default. This project is an example, so you have to make this choice yourself.
